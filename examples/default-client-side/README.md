## Miscellaneous FAQ

### Why are the dev tools scripts so verbose?

See [### Why are the dev tools scripts so verbose?

See [ADR-002: Prefer Configurable Dev Tools](docs/adr/002-prefer-configurable-dev-tools.md).

### Why are there so many config files?

See [ADR-003: Prefer Multiple Config Files](docs/adr/003-prefer-multiple-config-files.md).

### Why isn't the build bundled or minified?

See [ADR-004: Minimally Transform Source Code During Build](docs/adr/004-minimally-transform-source-code-during-build.md).

### Why does the Babel build script contain the `--source-maps` option?

This option is available in the Babel config file (`sourceMaps: true`), but has diffrent behaviour. Only the command line supports the creation of `.map` files. See [https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/5261](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/5261).

### Why does the `format:eslint` script ignore errors?

Linting errors should not be reported when formatting, that it was the `lint` command is for.

Errors are ignored by appending the following: `>/dev/null 2>&1 || true`.
