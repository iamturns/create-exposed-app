## Architectural Decision Records

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a design decision that addresses [Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements). An AD is hard to make and/or costly to change.

An [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) is a document that captures the AD, along with research, consequences, etc.

### Create a new ADR

Copy `.ADR-000-template.md` into a new file, and increase the number sequence.

### Remove an ADR

ADRs should not be removed. Instead they can be rejected, deprecated, or superseded with a new ADR. See the 'Status' field in the template file.
