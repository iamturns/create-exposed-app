# create-exposed-app

> App generator with everything exposed for maximum tweaking

Like zero-config? Get out!

Config files are exposed and ready to edit, not hidden away in one-of-those `node_modules` directories.

Scripts are in your face and tweakable, not tucked away behind a black box.

Because every app is unique.

Kick it off:

```bash
npm init exposed-app
```
