- Useful scripts: test, lint, format, upgrade, reinstall, and reset (powered by [iamturns-js-toolbox](https://github.com/iamturns/iamturns-js-toolbox))
- Beautify files (powered by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [import-sort](https://github.com/renke/import-sort), [prettier-package-json](https://github.com/cameronhunter/prettier-package-json))
- Automatically format, lint, and test changed files (powered by [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))
- CI/CD: automatically validate, version, and release on `git push` (powered by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release))
- [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) and documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, DEVELOPING.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, MAINTAINING.md, LICENSE)
